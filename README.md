# Funnel AE

The Funnel Transformer converted into an Autoencoder.

## ToDo

- [ ] Setup parameter sweep to see how well it can compress sentences.
- - [ ] Make trainer script for autoencoding a text dataset.
- - [ ] Run on wiki sentences with full ssequence accuracy in eval.
- - [ ] Make collab notebook to trigger training with W&B logs.
- - [ ] Get logs for many runs.
- [ ] Run parameter sweep with many options.
- - [ ] Extend to use encoder skip connections that gradually decay.
- - [ ] Add learned vector to upsampled hidden states?
- [ ] Train single token compression model on wiki sentences.
